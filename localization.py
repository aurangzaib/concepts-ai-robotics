Limit Distribution:
if a robot keeps moving with the inaccuracy in its movements not
corrected, in the end it will be on uniform distribution, called
state of maximal uncertainty. at this point, robot doesn't know exactly where it is.
it thinks it can be on any of the possible positions.

entropy: measure of info a distribution has
update(move)    --> loses entropy --> info decreases
measure(sense)  --> gains entropy --> info increases

      (sense|product|bayes rule)   -->   (move|convolution|total prob. theorem)
